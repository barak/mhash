  The mhash library provides the following features:

   o  Open-Source software (BSD-style license)
   o  Useable for both commercial and non-commercial use
   o  Reentrancy support through POSIX threads 
   o  Support for known strong algorithms
   o  Support for less-know algorithms such as GOST
   o  Should work on every ANSI C conforming platform

  Credits
  -------

  Special thanks to Nikos Mavroyanopoulos for his initial work on mhash. He is
  currently working on mcrypt, a library which implements several strong
  ciphers, and has passed the "stab" of maintaining and improving the library
  to me.
